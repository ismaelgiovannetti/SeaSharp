# Sea Sharp - Learn C# like a sea shark ðŸ¦ˆ

This is a special course I've put together so that my 12-year-old brother can discover the joys of programming and achieve the freedom to build whatever he wants. As he is drastically lacking in determination, each module of this course is made up of exercises with bonuses. For each exercise he completes, he will receive the equivalent of the bonus in CHF via Twint. As the level is progressive, I wish you good luck :)
